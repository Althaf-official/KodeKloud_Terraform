### We have a new configuration directory located at the path /root/terraform-projects/things-to-do. Inspect this directory and find out the number of providers initialized within this directory.

Go to the .terraform/providers directory and count the number of provider plugins installed. If the directory does not exist, there are no plugins downloaded yet.

### How about now? How many provider plugins are installed in this configuration directory?

"things to do" only


### How many configuration files exist in the directory: /root/terraform-projects/things-to-do ?

1

### How many resources are configured in this configuration directory?

2

### What is the version of the plugin for the local provider that has been downloaded for this configuration?

Run terraform init and inspect the output or check the version of the plugin downloaded inside the .terraform/providers directory.

2.4.0


### Now, go ahead and create these resources using terraform!

Once done, the two files defined inside the resource blocks should be created with the correct file names and content.


### We have created another directory containing configuration files at /root/terraform-projects/christmas-wishlist

### Create a new configuration file within the same directory called xbox.tf. This file should make use of the same local_file resource type with the below requirements:


Resource Name: xbox

filename: /root/xbox.txt

content: Wouldn't mind an XBox either!


Once the configuration file has been created, use the terraform workflow to create this resource.

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Run terraform plan (optional) and then terraform apply in the directory /root/terraform-projects/things-to-do.

### Now, navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/provider-a. We have downloaded a plugin in this directory. Identify the name and type of provider.


If the configuration files in this directory seem unfamiliar, do not worry, these are covered later in the course.


Run terraform init or inspect the .terraform directory. Also, make use of the documentation to determine the type of provider used.
