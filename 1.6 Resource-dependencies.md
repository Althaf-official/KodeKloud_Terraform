### Which argument should be used to explicitly set dependencies for a resource?

depends_on

### Resource A relies on another Resource B but doesn't access any of its attributes in its own arguments. What is this type of dependency called?

explicit dependency

### How do we make use of implicit dependency?

When we use reference expressions to link resources, the dependency created is called implicit dependency

### In the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/key-generator, create a file called key.tf with the following specifications:


Resource Type: tls_private_key

Resource Name: pvtkey

algorithm: RSA

rsa_bits: 4096


When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

### Now, let's use the private key created by this resource in another resource of type local file. Update the key.tf file with the requirements:


Resource Name: key_details

File Name: /root/key.txt

Content: use a reference expression to use the attribute called private_key_pem of the pvtkey resource.


When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.



Solution for key.tf :-
```
resource "tls_private_key" "pvtkey" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 4096
}

resource "local_file" "key_details" {
  content  = tls_private_key.pvtkey.private_key_pem
  filename = "/root/key.txt"
}

Okay, imagine you have a secret diary that you want to keep safe, and you have a special code (a key) to lock and unlock it. This code is so strong that it's called RSA, and it has 4096 bits of security, which makes it super-duper safe.

Now, in computer language, someone is telling the computer to create this special code (resource "tls_private_key" "pvtkey") with the RSA system and 4096 bits.

Then, just like writing in your diary, the computer is being told to write down the secret code in a file (resource "local_file" "key_details"). This file is like a piece of paper where the computer can keep track of the special code.

So, in short, this computer code is creating a really strong secret code (RSA key) and writing it down in a special file called "key.txt" so that the computer can use it later for something important.

### Now destroy these two resources.

  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

### Within this directory, create two local_file type resources in main.tf file.


Resource 1:

Resource Name: whale

File Name: /root/whale

content: whale


Resource 2:

Resource Name: krill

File Name: /root/krill

content: krill


Resource called whale should depend on krill but do not use reference expressions.


When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.


Use explicit dependency using depends_on.


```ruby
Solution for main.tf :-

resource "local_file" "whale" {
  filename   = "/root/whale"
  content    = "whale"
  depends_on = [local_file.krill]
}
resource "local_file" "krill" {
  filename = "/root/krill"
  content  = "krill"
}

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
- Installing hashicorp/local v2.4.0...
- Installed hashicorp/local v2.4.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

❯ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated
with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.krill will be created
  + resource "local_file" "krill" {
      + content              = "krill"

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so
Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if
you run "terraform apply" now.
