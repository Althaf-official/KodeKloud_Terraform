### In this lab, we will work on configuration directories that have been created under /root/terraform-projects/S3-Buckets.

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/KodeKloud_Terraform/assets/105126131/d2911e1d-4a0c-48b9-a765-85e1fe6ec03f)

### Let's first inspect the configuration files in the directory called MCU.


What is the AWS region configured for use in the provider block? (Assuming we do not pass in additional variables during command execution)


The provider block uses a variable called region. The value set in terraform.tfvars is us-east-1

### There is a resource block configured in the main.tf file in this configuration directory. What is the resource name that will be provisioned when we run terraform apply?


Inspect the resource block. The name of the resource is marvel-cinematic-universe.

```ruby

root in terraform-projects/S3-Buckets/MCU via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform apply
aws_s3_bucket.marvel-cinematic-universe: Refreshing state... [id=mcu-202011121359]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your
configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

root in terraform-projects/S3-Buckets/MCU via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) took 4s 
❯

```

### What is the current state of this configuration directory?

Resources provisioned

Run terraform plan and inspect the execution plan - It should not show any changes to apply.
Inspect the directory. It has already been initialized at least once as there is a .terraform directory with the aws plugin.
There is also a state file stored in the same directory which implies that we have run terraform apply at least once.


### What is the name of the s3 bucket that has been created by this configuration?

Inspect the resource block or run terraform show inside this configuration directory and inspect the attributes.
The latter is a better way as the terraform show command to queries the current state.

    bucket                      = "mcu-202011121359"

```ruby
root in terraform-projects/S3-Buckets/MCU via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) took 4s 
❯ terraform show
# aws_s3_bucket.marvel-cinematic-universe:
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "marvel-cinematic-universe" {
    arn                         = "arn:aws:s3:::mcu-202011121359"
    bucket                      = "mcu-202011121359"
    bucket_domain_name          = "mcu-202011121359.s3.amazonaws.com"
    bucket_regional_domain_name = "mcu-202011121359.s3.amazonaws.com"
    force_destroy               = false
    hosted_zone_id              = "Z3AQBSTGFYJSTF"
    id                          = "mcu-202011121359"
    object_lock_enabled         = false
    region                      = "us-east-1"
    request_payer               = "BucketOwner"
    tags                        = {}
    tags_all                    = {}

    grant {
        id          = "75aa57f09aa0c8caeab4f8c24e99d10f8e7faeebf76c078efc7c6caea54ba06a"
        permissions = [
            "FULL_CONTROL",
        ]
        type        = "CanonicalUser"
    }

    versioning {
        enabled    = false
        mfa_delete = false
    }
}

root in terraform-projects/S3-Buckets/MCU via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) took 2s 
```


### What is the DNS domain name that is created for this bucket?

Run terraform show inside this configuration directory and inspect the attribute called bucket_domain_name.


 bucket_domain_name          = "mcu-202011121359.s3.amazonaws.com

 ### Now, let's move on and work on a different configuration directory called DC.

 ### The main.tf file is empty. Use it to create a new S3 with the following specifications:
resource name: dc_bucket
bucket name: dc_is_better_than_marvel


Once the resource block is complete, run a terraform init, plan and apply to try and create the bucket.


If unsure, refer to the documentation. The documentation tab is available at the top right panel.

(it's ok if you get an error! Move on to the next question!)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so
Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.

### Why did the terraform apply command fail?

Invalid Bucket Name


### That's right! The bucket name we used does not conform to a DNS Name standard as it uses underscores.








### Let's fix that now and change the bucket name so that it uses dashes (-) instead of underscore(_).

resource name: dc_bucket
bucket name: dc-is-better-than-marvel


Once the resource block is complete, run a terraform init, plan and apply to try and create the bucket.

### Let's move on to the next configuration directory called Pixar.
Same as the directory called DC, we have the provider.tf, variables.tf, terraform.tfvars and an empty main.tf file that is already created.


Change directory to Pixar and move on to the next question.

Change directory to Pixar and move on to the next question.


### We have a file called woody.jpg stored at /root that has to be uploaded to a bucket called pixar-studios-2020. This bucket already exists though and was created using the AWS CLI.

### Let's do that now and upload this image to the s3 bucket! Update the main.tf file with the following specifications:

Bucket: pixar-studios-2020
Key: woody.jpg
Source: /root/woody.jpg


Once ready, proceed to run terraform init, plan and apply.



Solution for main.tf :-

resource "aws_s3_object" "upload" {
  bucket = "pixar-studios-2020"
  key    = "woody.jpg"
  source = "/root/woody.jpg"
}
