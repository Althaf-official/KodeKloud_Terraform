### Can we use multiple providers in the same configuration directory?

Yes! we can use as many providers as needed within the same configuration.

### We have a new configuration directory located at the path /root/terraform-projects/multi-provider. Inspect this directory and find out the number of providers initialized.


Go to the .terraform/providers directory and count the number of provider plugins installed. If the directory does not exist, there are no plugins downloaded yet.

Hey there! Imagine you're setting up a virtual world, and you want to create a little document about pets. In this world, there's a special place (let's call it "/root/") where you can store files, like notes or documents.

Now, you want to create a file named "pets.txt" in this special place, and you want it to say "We love pets!" inside. The code you provided is like a set of instructions for this virtual world to make that happen. It's saying:

1. **Create a File:**
   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "pet_name" {
     content  = "We love pets!"
     filename = "/root/pets.txt"
   }
   ```
   This part is saying, "Hey, create a file named 'pet_name' using the 'local_file' resource. Put the text 'We love pets!' in it, and save it at the location '/root/pets.txt'."

2. **Generate a Random Pet Name:**
   ```hcl
   resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
     prefix    = "Mrs"
     separator = "."
     length    = "1"
   }
   ```
   Now, this part is a bit more playful! It's saying, "Let's create a random pet name using the 'random_pet' resource. Start with 'Mrs' as a prefix, use a dot as a separator, and make the name 1 word long."

So, in this virtual world, you'd end up with a file called "pets.txt" in the "/root/" place, saying "We love pets!" inside. Additionally, you'd have a randomly generated pet name, maybe something like "Mrs.Fluffy" or "Mrs.Sparky" each time you run this code. It's like creating a little personalized touch to your virtual pet world!



### Now, run the terraform init command and inspect the .terraform/providers directory. Count the number of plugins downloaded.
### How many plugins are available now in this configuration directory?

You can go into the path /root/terraform-projects/multi-provider/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/ and count the number of plugins installed.

### Now, Navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/MPL. Create a new configuration file called pet-name.tf.
This file should make use of the local_file and random_pet resource type with the below requirements:

local_file resource details:

Resource name = "my-pet"

File name = "/root/pet-name"

Content = "My pet is called finnegan!!"


random_pet resource details:

Resource name = "other-pet"

Length = "1"

Prefix = "Mr"

Separator = "."


Once the configuration file has been created, use the terraform workflow to create this resource.



```yaml
The solution is provided below:

Create pet-name.tf file with following contents:

resource "local_file" "my-pet" {
     filename = "/root/pet-name"
     content = "My pet is called finnegan!!"

}
resource "random_pet" "other-pet" {
     length = 1
     prefix = "Mr"
     separator = "."

}

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

❯ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.my-pet will be created
  + resource "local_file" "my-pet" {
      + content              = "My pet is called finnegan!!"
      + content_base64sha256 = (known after apply)
      + content_base64sha512 = (known after apply)
      + content_md5          = (known after apply)
      + content_sha1         = (known after apply)
      + content_sha256       = (known after apply)
      + content_sha512       = (known after apply)
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/root/pet-name"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # random_pet.other-pet will be created
  + resource "random_pet" "other-pet" {
      + id        = (known after apply)
      + length    = 1
      + prefix    = "Mr"
      + separator = "."
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this
plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly
these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

### Now change into the directory /root/terraform-projects/provider and inspect the file cloud-provider.tf.
What is the instance_type configured with the resource type called aws_instance?

### What is the name of the resource configured with the resource type kubernetes_namespace in kube.tf file within the same directory?

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/KodeKloud_Terraform/assets/105126131/a18384cc-637d-425b-9e8f-f1085231bebd)

### Let's get some more practice! Now navigate to the directory path /root/terraform-projects/provider-a. Create a configuration file called code.tf.

Using the local_file resource type, write the resource block with the below requirements into the file:

Resource name = iac_code

File name = /opt/practice

Content = Setting up infrastructure as code


When ready, only run the terraform init command, we will run the terraform apply command later on.


```bash
The solution is provided below:

Create code.tf file with following contents:

resource "local_file" "iac_code" {
          filename = "/opt/practice"
          content = "Setting up infrastructure as code"
}



```


### This is because whenever we add a resource for a provider that has not been used so far in the configuration directory, we have to initialize the directory by running terraform init command.

Let's do that now. Run terraform init followed by terraform apply command.
