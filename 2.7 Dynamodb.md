### In this lab, we will work with DynamoDB tables using terraform.


The configuration directories have been created under /root/terraform-projects/DynamoDB.

### We have already created a resource block for a DynamoDB table inside /root/terraform-projects/DynamoDB/project-sapphire-user-data/.


But something is wrong with this configuration. Try running a terraform plan or validate and identify the cause of the failure.

Refer the resource documentation here: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dynamodb_table

Attribute for Primary Key is Missing

### That's right! At a minimum, the Primary Key should be defined as an attribute when creating a DynamoDB table.
In this configuration, we should add the attribute for UserId for it to work.

### Let's fix that now! Update the main.tf file so that it uses an attribute for the Primary/Hash Key.
Note that the UserId should be a number.

Update type as Number for the UserID in the main.tf.

```ruby
The solution to update main.tf is provided below:

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "project_sapphire_user_data" {
  name           = "userdata"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "UserId"

  attribute {
    name = "UserId"
    type = "N"
  }
}

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_dynamodb_table.project_sapphire_user_data will be created

      + arn              = (known after apply)

### What is the name of the DynamoDB table resource that is created by this configuration?


project_sapphire_inventory

### What is the name of the DynamoDB Table that is created this configuration?
inventory
### how many attribute
4
### What is the name and type of the Primary Key used by this table?
AssetId - Number

### Now, let's add an item to this table called inventory. Use the following specifications and update the main.tf file:


Resource Name: upload

Table = Use reference expression to the table called inventory

Hash Key = Use reference expression to use the primary key used by the table inventory


Use the below data for item:

{

"AssetID": {"N": "1"},

"AssetName": {"S": "printer"},

"age": {"N": "5"},

"Hardware": {"B": "true" }

}


when ready, run terraform init, plan and apply
