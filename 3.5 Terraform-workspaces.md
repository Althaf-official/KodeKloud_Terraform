## When we start off and create a configuration in terraform, what is the workspace that is created, to begin with?

The default workspace is created automatically.

You can list the workspace by running the following command: terraform workspace list

## Navigate to the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire. We have a few configuration files already created here. How may workspaces are created for this configuration currently?

## Create three new workspaces called us-payroll, uk-payroll and india-payroll.

Run the following commands:

terraform workspace new us-payroll

terraform workspace new uk-payroll

terraform workspace new india-payroll


```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform workspace list
* default


root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ 

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform workspace new us-payroll
Created and switched to workspace "us-payroll"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.

  uk-payroll
  us-payroll


root in ~/terraform-projects/project-sapphire via üí† india-payroll on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ 
```

## Now, switch to the workspace called us-payroll.

## Where would the state file for the workspace called india-payroll be stored??


Choose the correct path relative to the current configuration directory (/root/terraform-projects/project-sapphire)

When working with workspaces, terraform creates a directory called terraform.tfstate.d in the configuration directory. Within this directory, the state file will be then created inside another directory by the same name as the workspace.

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Terraform/assets/105126131/2ddcf31a-e782-4786-948b-027b6465fcd3)


./terraform.tfstate.d/india-payroll

## Let's now write the main.tf file to make use of the same module that we saw in the terraform modules lecture.

The project-sapphire configuration directory will be used to deploy the same payroll application stack in different regions.

The module is located at the path /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app.



## Inside the configuration directory, we have already added the variables.tf and the provider.tf file. Inspect them.

map

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Terraform/assets/105126131/89afe27a-866a-4252-ab19-369d78cddb70)

## Now, update the main.tf of the root module to call the child module located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app. Adhere to the following specifications:

module name: payroll_app
This module expects two mandatory arguments:

a. app_region - use the values from variable called region

b. ami - use the values from the variable called ami
The values for these two arguments should be selected based on the workspace you are on.


For example, if on us-payroll workspace, the app_region should be us-east-1 and the ami ami-24e140119877avm OR for uk-payroll, the app_region should be eu-west-2 and the ami ami-35e140119877avm e.t.c .

Once ready, run terraform init. You don't have to create(apply) the resources yet!
Refer to the README.md file located at /root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app to see how to use this module.

Use the lookup function and terraform.workspace expression to lookup the correct values from the map.

Solution for main.tf :-
```
module "payroll_app" {
  source = "/root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app"
  app_region = lookup(var.region, terraform.workspace)
  ami        = lookup(var.ami, terraform.workspace)
}
