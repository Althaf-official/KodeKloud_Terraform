## Which environment variable should be used to export the logs to a specific path?

Use the variable `TF_LOG_PATH`

## Can you export the debug logs from terraform just by setting TF_LOG_PATH environment variable and providing a path as the value to this variable?

You also need to export the variable TF_LOG and set it to one of the log levels.

## We have a configuration directory called /root/terraform-projects/ProjectA. Enable logging with the log level set to ERROR and then export the logs the path /tmp/ProjectA.log.


Once the environment variables are set, run a terraform init and apply.

It's OK if this results in an error. Do not change any configuration files before you export the logs!


Run: `export TF_LOG=ERROR` and `export TF_LOG_PATH=/tmp/ProjectA.log`

Then run command such as `terraform init; terraform apply` inside the directory called `/root/terraform-projects/ProjectA`

```ruby

root in ~/terraform-projects/ProjectA via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) took 4s 
❯ terraform apply

## Which Log Level provides the most details when you run terraform commands?


TRACE provides the most verbose logs.

## Now navigate to /root/terraform-projects/ProjectB. We already have a main.tf file created for provisioning an AWS EC2 instance with the tag Name: projectb_webserver.


Run a terraform init and apply to provision this instance

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so
Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.

### Why is the resource called ProjectB being replaced?

ProjectB resource is tainted

Run terraform plan and inspect the output. A taint was set on this resource.

Warning: taint command is deprecated. For Terraform v0.15.2 and later, we recommend using the -replace option with terraform apply instead.


### Untaint the resource called ProjectB so that the resource is not replaced any more.


The resource is currently tainted.

Run: terraform untaint aws_instance.ProjectB
