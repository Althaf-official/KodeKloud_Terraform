### A data source once created, can be used to create, update, and destroy infrastructure?



A datasource can only read resource data and use that information within terraform.

### A data source can be created using the data block.

### A new configuration directory has been created at /root/terraform-projects/project-lexcorp. A data source block is defined in the main.tf file to read the contents of an existing file.

There is also an output variable that uses reference expression to print the file content using this data source. However, there is something wrong!


Troubleshoot and fix the issue.


When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply to create the datasource. The configuration should print the output variable correctly.

It seems like there's an issue with the Terraform code. The error is indicating that the data resource named "local_file" with the content attribute is not declared. Let's correct the code:



```hcl
data "local_file" "os" {
  filename = "/etc/os-release"
}

output "os-version" {
  value = data.local_file.os.content
}
```



In the corrected code:

1. I've moved the declaration of the `data "local_file"` block before the `output` block. Terraform requires that resources be declared before they are referenced.

2. In the `output` block, I'm referencing the content attribute of the `data.local_file.os` resource. The `os` corresponds to the name given to the data block.

After making these changes, run `terraform plan` again, and it should resolve the "undeclared resource" error. This Terraform code reads the content of the "/etc/os-release" file and outputs it as "os-version".

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/project-lexcorp via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform apply
data.local_file.os: Reading...

You can apply this plan to save these new output
values to the Terraform state, without changing any
real infrastructure.

### Now let's practice how to work with data sources from other providers.

The next few questions will be based on the aws provider.
Although we have only predominantly worked with local and the random provider, this exercise will help you learn how to work with different data sources using the documentation.


Don't worry if the configuration blocks and the arguments are unfamiliar. We will cover them in detail in the upcoming section.


### We have now created a new configuration file called ebs.tf within the same configuration directory we have been working on.

What is the resource type that we are working with here?

Just like a regular resource, the keyword following data is the resource type aws_ebs_volume

### Once this data source is created, how do we fetch the Volume Id for the resource that is created in AWS?


Check the attribute reference for the ebs volume:

volume_id


### Another file called s3.tf has now been created. It too has a data source that will be used to read data of an existing s3 bucket.


However, there is a mistake in the argument used. What is wrong here?


You may have to look up the documentation for this one. Documentation tab is available at the top right.


The argument should be bucket not bucket_name.
