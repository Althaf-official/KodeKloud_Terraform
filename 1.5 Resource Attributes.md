### What is the resource_type of the resource that's currently defined in the main.tf file?

The resource_type used is time_static from the provider called time.

### As you can see, the resource block is empty. This is because time_static does not need any arguments to be supplied to work.

When applied as it is, terraform creates a logical resource locally (similar to random_pet) with the current time.

### Which of the following attributes are exported by the time_static resource?

The resource exports an attribute called id. We can see the attributes for the resource once its created by using terraform commands, we will see them in the upcoming lectures.

### How do we refer to the attribute called id using a reference expression?

The syntax of the reference is resource_type.resource_name.attribute.

### Now, update the main.tf file and add a new local_file resource called time with the following requirements:

filename: /root/time.txt
content: Time stamp of this file is <id from time_update resource>


Use a reference expression and interpolation.

When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.

```ruby

resource "local_file" "time" {
  filename = "/root/time.txt"
  content = "Time stamp of this file is ${time_static.time_update.id}"

 }
 resource "time_static" "time_update" {
}

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform has no command named "planm". Did you mean "plan"?

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.time will be created

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform
apply" now.

### What is the attribute called id that is created for the local file resource called time?


Make use of the terraform show command and identify the attribute values.

### What is the attribute called rfc3339 that is created for the time_static resource called time_update?


Make use of the terraform show command and identify the attribute values.
