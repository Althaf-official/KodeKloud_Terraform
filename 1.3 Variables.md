### An array type is not valid in terraform.


### Navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/variables. Which type does the variable called number belong to?


```ruby
variable "name" {
     type = string
     default = "Mark"
  
}
variable "number" {
     type = bool
     default = true
  
}
variable "distance" {
     type = number
     default = 5
  
}
variable "jedi" {
     type = map
     default = {
     filename = "/root/first-jedi"
     content = "phanius"
     }
  
}

variable "gender" {
     type = list(string)
     default = ["Male", "Female"]
}
variable "hard_drive" {
     type = map
     default = {
          slow = "HHD"
          fast = "SSD"
     }
}
variable "users" {
     type = set(string)
     default = ["tom", "jerry", "pluto", "daffy", "donald", "jerry", "chip", "dale"]

  
}
```

### How would you fetch the value of the key called slow from the variable called hard_drive in a terraform configuration?

Use key matching.

key = slow

So here we fetch the value for the key called slow from the map as:

var.hard_drive["slow"]

### What is the index of the element called Female in the variable called gender?

### What is the type of variable called users?
This variable is defined in the same variables.tf file. The type used is set(string).


### Now, let's update this resource and add variables instead. Use the default value declared in the variable called jedi.


This variable is a map. For the argument called content use the value of the key by the same name.
And, similarly, for the argument called filename use the value by the same name.

Variable called jedi is a map, so we have to use below syntax :-
```ruby

resource "local_file" "jedi" {
     filename = var.jedi["filename"]
     content = var.jedi["content"]
}

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

❯ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the
following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.jedi will be created
  + resource "local_file" "jedi" {
      + content              = "phanius"
      + content_base64sha256 = (known after apply)
      + content_base64sha512 = (known after apply)
      + content_md5          = (known after apply)
      + content_sha1         = (known after apply)
      + content_sha256       = (known after apply)
      + content_sha512       = (known after apply)
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/root/first-jedi"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this
plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly
these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
