### We have created a configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-shazam. The configuration file inside will be used to create an RSA type private key and then a certificate signing request or a csr using this key.

However, there is an error with the configuration.

Use the terraform validate command, troubleshoot, and fix the issue.

The argument called dsa_bits in the resource block for creating the private key is incorrect. For RSA algorithm, the correct argument to use is rsa_bits.

Lookup the resource arguments from the documentation for more information.

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/project-shazam via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform validate
╷
│ Error: Unsupported argument

│   on main.tf line 8, in resource "tls_private_key" "private_key":
│    8:   dsa_bits  = 2048
│ 
│ An argument named "dsa_bits" is not expected here. Did you mean
│ "rsa_bits"?
╵

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-shazam via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.

### Now, try creating the resources with a terraform apply.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following

Terraform will perform the following actions:

## The terraform apply failed in spite of our validation working! This is because the validate command only carries out a general verification of the configuration. It validated the resource block and the argument syntax but not the values the arguments expect for a specific resource!

### The error in the configuration is inside the resource block for the tls_private_key type resource.
It contains the configuration that we needed for generating rsa type key..

Inspect the resource block and fix the issue.


Once done, run terraform plan and then apply to created the resources.

The Algorithm used by the tls_private_key is RSA but the configuration also mentions ecdsa_curve argument.

### Now format the main.tf file into a canonical format.

Run the terraform fmt command in the configuration directory.

### Now, navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/project-a. We have already created the resources specified in this configuration.

Fetch details from the state file and identify the value of the filename argument.

Use the terraform show command to inspect the terraform.tfstate file.

### In these terraform labs, we have used multiple providers so far. But, what are providers?

Plugins

Reference link:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/provider-requirements.html#about-providers


### Which one is a valid sub-command of the terraform providers command?

Run the terraform providers --help option.

```ruby

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-a via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform providers --help

Usage: terraform [global options] providers [DIR]

  Prints out a tree of modules in the referenced configuration annotated with
  their provider requirements.

  This provides an overview of all of the provider requirements across all
  referenced modules, as an aid to understanding why particular provider
  plugins are needed and why particular versions are selected.


Subcommands:
    lock      Write out dependency locks for the configured providers
    mirror    Save local copies of all required provider plugins
    schema    Show schemas for the providers used in the configuration

root in ~/terraform-projects/project-a via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯

```

### A new configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/provider has been created. We have already run the terraform init command.
Now check the provider plugins that have been downloaded from the command line utility (instead of inspecting the .terraform directory). After that choose the correct option.

Run the terraform providers command to see the options.
