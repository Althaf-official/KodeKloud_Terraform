### Which configuration block is defined in the main.tf file at the moment?
module

## What is the source of the module used in this configuration?

Inspect the source of the module. It uses the public registry: registry.terraform.io

public terraform registry

## What is the version of the module used?

5.28.0

## How many required arguments does this module expect?

1

You may need to look up the documentation to figure this one out.
Refer: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest/submodules/iam-user

## Which argument is to be specified, just to create an IAM User with this module?


You may need to look up the documentation to figure this one out.
Refer: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest/submodules/iam-user

The only required argument is name.

### Now, update this module block that will allow it to create an IAM User called max. Adhere to the following requirements:

Only use the module block in the main.tf file, do not add a separate resource block.
Module Name - iam_iam-user
Only add the single required argument at this time.


The provider.tf and variables.tf files have been added to this configuration directory now.

When ready, run a terraform init and plan. You don't have to provision the resources at this moment but you can try should you wish to!

```ruby
Add an argument to the module block:

name = "max"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The solution is provided below:

Update the main.tf file:

module "iam_iam-user" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-user"
  version = "5.28.0"
  # insert the 1 required variable here
  name = "max"
}

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the

with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so
Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if
you run "terraform apply" now.

## How many resources are set to be created in the execution plan ?


3


## Which resources are set to be created?
create_iam_access_key, create_iam_user_login_profile and create_user


## Why is the module creating additional resources, when only the name for creating an IAM User was defined in the main.tf file?


Inspect the Inputs for this module in the documentation:
https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws/latest/submodules/iam-user

The optional arguments create_iam_access_key, create_iam_user_login_profile and create_user all have a default value of true.


the three resources will be created by default as per the module configuration


## We only want to create the IAM User. Update the module block to only allow create_user. Disable create_iam_access_key and create_iam_user_login_profile.

```ruby
When ready, run the terraform workflow to create the resources.


Add arguments create_iam_access_key and create_iam_user_login_profile and set it to false.


The solution is provided below:

Update the main.tf file as shown

module "iam_iam-user" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-user"
  version = "5.28.0"
  # insert the 1 required variable here
  name                          = "max"
  create_iam_user_login_profile = false
  create_iam_access_key         = false
}
