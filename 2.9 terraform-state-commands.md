### We have created a few resources in the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/project-anime. Inspect it.


Which of the following resources names are not part of the terraform state?

Run terraform state list and find out the resource address not part of the list.

### Which command would you use to show the attributes of the resource called classics stored in the terraform state?

Run terraform state show local_file.classics

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/project-anime via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform state show local_file.classics
# local_file.classics:
resource "local_file" "classics" {

### What is the value of the attribute called id that is created for the local file resource called top10?

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/project-anime via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform state show local_file.top10

### We no longer wish to manage the file located at /root/anime/hall-of-fame.txt by Terraform. Remove the resource responsible for this file completely from the management of terraform.

Remove the resource block called hall_of_fame from the main.tf and also remove it from the state file by running terraform state rm local_file.hall_of_fame.

### Now navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/super-pets. Just like the previous configuration directory, we have already created the resource. Inspect the configuration and identify the only resource type used.

Either inspect the main.tf file (which contains the configuration) or run terraform state list and identify the resource type from the resource address.

### Within this configuration the terraform state commands are working (Try it!) but there is no terraform.tfstate file present!

What is the reason for this behavior?

We are making use of a remote state in this configuration. Check out the remote s3 backend configuration in the terraform.tf file

### What is the id of the random_pet resource called super_pet_2 in the state file?

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/super-pets via üí† default on ‚òÅÔ∏è  (us-east-1) 
‚ùØ terraform state show random_pet.super_pet_2
# random_pet.super_pet_2:
resource "random_pet" "super_pet_2" {
    id        = "Wonder-nice-cobra"
    length    = 2
    prefix    = "Wonder"
    separator = "-"
}

```

### Rename the resource from super_pet_1 to ultra_pet.


Change the name in the main.tf file as well as the state.

Change the name in the main.tf and also run terraform state mv random_pet.super_pet_1 random_pet.ultra_pet.
