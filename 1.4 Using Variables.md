### How can we use environment variables to pass input variables in terraform scripts?

Export variables using the prefix TF_VAR_ followed by the variable name and a value.

### Which method has the highest priority in Variable Definition Precedence?

commandline var-

### Which one of the following commands is a valid way to make use of a custom variable file with the terraform apply command?

Use the -var-file option with a variable file. The file can be named anything but should always end in either .tfvars or .tfvars.json.


terraform apply -var-file variables.tfvars

### We have created some files under the directory /root/terraform-projects/variables. Inspect it.

### What will happen if we run terraform plan command right now?

The configuration file uses a variable called filename which is not declared. As a result, the plan command will not work.

```ruby

root in ~/terraform-projects/variables via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ ls
basket.auto.tfvars  main.tf  terraform.tfvars  throw.auto.tfvars

root in ~/terraform-projects/variables via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terrafrom plan
bash: terrafrom: command not found

root in ~/terraform-projects/variables via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform plan

The terraform plan command did not run as there was no reference for the input variable called filename in the configuration files.



### Declare the variable called filename with type string in the file variables.tf.
Don't have to specify a default value.

Solution available for variables.tf file :-

variable filename {
  type = string
}

### If we run terraform apply with a -var command line flag as shown below, which value would be considered by terraform?


terraform apply -var filename=/root/tennis.txt

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/variables via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform apply -var filename=/root/tennis.txt

Terraform used the selected providers to generate
the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.games will be created
  + resource "local_file" "games" {
      + content              = "football"
      + content_base64sha256 = (known after apply)
      + content_base64sha512 = (known after apply)
      + content_md5          = (known after apply)
      + content_sha1         = (known after apply)
      + content_sha256       = (known after apply)
      + content_sha512       = (known after apply)
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/root/tennis.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

local_file.games: Creating...
local_file.games: Creation complete after 0s [id=2d27b62c597ec858f6e7b54e7e58525e6a95e6d8]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

root in ~/terraform-projects/variables via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) took 4s 
❯ 
```


### Terraform follows a variable definition precedence order to determine the value and the command line flag of –var or –var-file takes the highest priority.
