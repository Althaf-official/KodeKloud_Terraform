### Navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/omega where we have added a configuration file. Inspect the file and choose the correct version of the provider from the below options:

### Now, change to the directory /root/terraform-projects/rotate. We have already initialized the configuration directory using the terraform init command.
Inspect the rotation.tf file and find out the correct version of the provider plugin that is downloaded.
Choose the correct version from the below options:

Go onto the .terraform/providers configuration directory and inspect the correct version which has got downloaded.

### Which one of the below is not a valid version constraint operator?

### We have been working on a project called nautilus under the configuration directory /root/terraform-projects/nautilus.
Due to a version mismatch, we don't want to download the aws provider version 3.17.0. Which version constraint can be used to achieve this?

Operator "!=" excludes an exact version which we will specify. It will not download that version at all.

### Now, navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/lexicorp where we have added the configuration files. Inspect the file and find out which version of providers will be download.

The code snippet you provided is a configuration block in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), commonly used in Terraform. This specific block is configuring a module for Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes applications. Let's break down the key elements:

```hcl
helm = {
  source  = "hashicorp/helm"
  version = "~> 1.2.0"
}
```

1. **`helm`**: This is a block configuration for a Helm module. It indicates that this particular part of the configuration is related to Helm.

2. **`source`**: This specifies the source repository or location from which to fetch the Helm module. In this case, it's "hashicorp/helm," meaning it's pulling the Helm module from the HashiCorp namespace on whatever module registry or repository is configured.

3. **`version`**: This specifies the version of the Helm module to use. The version is set to "~> 1.2.0," which is a version constraint. It means any version that is at least 1.2.0 but less than 2.0.0 is acceptable. The `~>` symbol is a shorthand way of expressing this kind of version constraint.

In summary, this configuration block is instructing Terraform to use the Helm module from the HashiCorp namespace, and specifically, it's requesting a version between 1.2.0 (inclusive) and 2.0.0 (exclusive). This is a common approach to ensure compatibility while allowing for updates that don't introduce breaking changes.
