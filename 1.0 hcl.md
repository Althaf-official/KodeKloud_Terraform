### What is the resource type specified in this file?

### What is the resource name used for the local_file resource in this configuration file?

### What is the name of the provider for which we are creating this resource?


Inspect the resource type used. The value before the underscore _ in the resource type is usually the provider.
In this case it is local.

### Which one of the below is not an example of an argument used within the resource block?

### If you run a terraform plan now? Would it work?

For a newly created configuration, you must run the terraform init first.

### Run a terraform init inside the configuration directory: /root/terraform-projects/HCL

Run: cd  /root/terraform-projects/HCL and then run terraform init to initialized the working directory.


```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/HCL via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
- Installing hashicorp/local v2.4.0...
- Installed hashicorp/local v2.4.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

root in ~/terraform-projects/HCL via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ 
```


### What was the version of the local provider plugin that was downloaded?

Inspect the output of the terraform init command.

### Now, try to run a terraform plan.

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/HCL via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform plan
╷
│ Error: Missing required argument
│

│

╵

root in ~/terraform-projects/HCL via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ 
```


### Why did the command fail?


Inspect the error produced when the command was run.

If unsure, refer to the documentation. The documentation tab is available at the top right.

An argument called file does not exist for the local_file resource. Refer to the documentation to know more about arguments.

Invalid Aurgument

### Which of the following is not a valid argument for the local_file resource?

file

### Fix the argument in the configuration file and then run a terraform plan followed by terraform apply to create the local_file resource called games

Change the argument name from file to filename and then run terraform plan --> terraform apply

### We have now created our very first resource using Terraform! Next, let's work on updating the resource.

If you look at the output produced by the terraform plan and terraform apply commands closely, we can see that the file content is printed on the screen.

Since we do not want this to happen, we have updated the resource type.


What is the resource type that we have updated?

local_sensitive_file

### That's right, we have made use of the local_sensitive_file resource type to mask the contents of the file from the execution plan.

However, something is wrong. If we run terraform plan or terraform apply now we see an error!


Identify and fix the issue.
Remember, we don't want the content of the file to show up in the execution plan at all.


Issues fixed and the resource re-created?


Delete the line containing the argument called sensitive_content and then run terraform plan and then terraform apply to re-create the file.


resource "local_sensitive_file" "games" {
  filename     = "/root/favorite-games"
  content  = "FIFA 21"
}

### Notice that the content of the file was not displayed when using local_sensitive_file instead of the local_file resource.

Note: Refer to the documentation to see all the arguments supported by this resource.


Also note that as Terraform follows an immutable infrastructure approach, the file was recreated although the contents are the same.
