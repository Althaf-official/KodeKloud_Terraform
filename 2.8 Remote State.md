### In this lab, we will work with remote terraform state files.
We will first start with the local state and then migrate it to remote state with an S3 backend.


The configuration directory we will work with is /root/terraform-projects/RemoteState

### First, create a simple configuration to create a local_file resource within the directory called RemoteState. The resource block should be created inside the main.tf file. Follow the below specifications for provisioning this resource:

Resource Name: state

filename: /root/<variable local-state>

content: "This configuration uses <variable local-state> state"


Use the variable called local-state in the variables.tf file which is already created for you and make use of variable interpolation syntax ${..}.

Once the configuration is ready, run a terraform init, plan and apply.

```ruby
Solution for main.tf :-

resource "local_file" "state" {
  filename = "/root/${var.local-state}"
  content  = "This configuration uses ${var.local-state} state"

}

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
- Installing hashicorp/local v2.4.0...
- Installed hashicorp/local v2.4.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.state will be created
  + resource "local_file" "state" {
      + content              = "This configuration uses local state"
      + content_base64sha256 = (known after apply)

    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so
Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.

### Has a state file been created after you run terraform apply?

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Terraform/assets/105126131/6e080787-dcc8-4021-ac30-48385adde412)


### What is the name of the state file created for this configuration?

terraform.tfstate


### Let's now move the state to a remote S3 backend. For this, we will make use of an S3 compatible storage called minio.

Minio provides an S3-compatible API and allows us to configure the s3 backend in the same way as the actual S3 service in AWS Cloud.


To explore minio and the S3 bucket that has been created, click on the Minio Browser tab on the top of the terminal window..

### We have already created an s3 bucket that we will use to store the remote state. From the Minio Browser, identify the name of this bucket. (There is only one bucket created as of now)

Click on the Minio Browser tab in the terminal window and identify the name of the single bucket that is available (Look under the Buckets tab).

remote-state

### Before we add the configuration for the s3 backend, let's first change the local file resource. Change the variable used to remote-state instead of local-state.


Once done, run terraform plan and apply.

In a TF file, replace the variable local-state to remote-state only and then run terraform plan (optional) and terraform apply.

```ruby
Solution for main.tf :-

resource "local_file" "state" {
  filename = "/root/${var.remote-state}"
  content  = "This configuration uses ${var.remote-state} state"

### Great! Now, let us configure the remote backend with s3. Add a terraform block in a new file called terraform.tf with the following arguments:


bucket: remote-state

key: terraform.tfstate

region: us-east-1


Do not run terraform init yet! Since we are making use of minio we also have to add a couple of additional arguments to get this to work!
We will do that in the next step. When using the regular s3 service from AWS the above arguments should be sufficient to configure remote state.

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Terraform/assets/105126131/4576d9dc-ca12-4dc0-8d35-f21632419395)


### To make the s3 backend with Minio to work, we have to add a few additional arguments. The terraform.tf file has been updated. Check it out.

Please note that these arguments are optional and not needed when working with the regular S3 service in AWS.

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Terraform/assets/105126131/2a159680-3ebb-4c43-83cc-0da7825c459c)


### Try running terraform apply, are you able to do it? If not why?

Since we added the new s3 backend configuration, the directory has to be reinitialized.

```ruby
root in ~/terraform-projects/RemoteState via 💠 default on ☁️  (us-east-1) 
❯ terraform apply
╷

### Run terraform init in our configuration directory now.


Once done you can proceed to delete the terraform.tfstate file from the local directory.

From the Minio Browser, you should now be able to see the state file uploaded to the bucket called remote-state.

Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes


Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/local from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/local v2.4.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
